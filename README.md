# AImware
This project is intended purely for education purposes. Keep in mind it is not intended to bypass any anti-cheats or gain an unfair advantage, no attempt to bypass anticheats was made and some games may detect and ban for the use of this program. 

This is a work in progress, and unoptimized! (May even cause a disadvantage in terms of performance issues hindering ability to aim properly... hopefully fixed soon).

Currently being updated in a private respository, updates soon
